* Once you have verified your account, sign into www.exchangerate-api.com and retreive your API key.
* In the currency-exchange-main diretory, create a .env file and paste your API key into it labeled as "API_KEY=[your API key here]"
* Install the required packages by running the command "NPM install" in a terminal, taking care to ensure you are within the currency-exchange-main directory.

* Finally, run the command "NPM run start" to start a development server.

## Known Bugs

* The North Korean Wan (KPW) is unsupported and cannot be converted for geopolitical reasons.
* In addition, the following currencies may not return an accurate exchange rate due to heightened volatility and substantial differences between the official exchange rate and the informal (i.e., local) exchange rate. Use caution when interpreting your results:
- LYD: Libyan Dinar
- SSP: South Sudanese Pound
- SYP: Syrian Pound
- VES: Venezuelan Bol√≠var Soberano
- YER: Yemeni Rial
- ZWL: Zimbabwean Dollar
